## Overview 
The purpose of this project was to analyze existing bike sharing data from the city of New York in order to gain insight into what makes the program successful. Using these insights, this project will advise a group of investors on the feasibility of a similar program in Des Moines, Iowa. Visualizations of the analysis were created and provided below.

## Results
The analysis included 7 visualizations: 
1) Map of starting points - this map shows where the most frequent starting points are, suggesting that bike sharing is most frequently used in areas of dense population, particularly where there are many professionals/ areas with many jobs, and prominent tourist locations.
2) Bar chart to show hours most frequently ridden during the month of August. This suggests that 4pm to 8pm are the hours where ride sharing is most frequently used, as well as 8 am, while 2 am to 5 am are hours where bike sharing use is at a minimum. 
3) A heat map to the stop time by day of week: showing what time during each weekday the bike sharing program is most often used. In this case, weekdays show increased usage during early morning or evening hours, suggest use by commuters on their way to work. On the weekend, the usage is more widespread, suggesting its used more often for tourism/ personal activities.
4) A second heat map to breakdown the results of 3) by gender. The patterns are similar across genders in terms of usage, but males use the program more frequently than any other gender.
5) A third heat map is used to break down usage by gender, day of the week, and customer type. Usage is similar across the days of the week relative to our analysis in 3. In addition, this heat map also reconfirms that males use the program more often. Finally, it shows that subscribers, rather than casual customers, more frequently use the bike sharing program.
6) A line graph that breaks down the trip duration in minutes and hours. This shows that most rides last 5-10 minutes and the frequency of rides decreases the longer the ride is. Around an hour mark, we can see that rides are not frequently longer than one hour.
7) A second line graph similar to 6) but broken down by gender. This graph reconfirms the insights in 4) and 6), where most rides last between 5-10 minutes and males more frequently use the bike sharing program.
