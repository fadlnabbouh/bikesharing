## Overview 
The purpose of this project was to analyze existing bike sharing data from the city of New York in order to gain insight into what makes the program successful. Using these insights, this project will advise a group of investors on the feasibility of a similar program in Des Moines, Iowa. Visualizations of the analysis were created and provided below.

## Results
The analysis included 7 visualizations: 
1) Map of starting points - this map shows where the most frequent starting points are, suggesting that bike sharing is most frequently used in areas of dense population, particularly where there are many professionals/ areas with many jobs, and prominent tourist locations.
2) Bar chart to show hours most frequently ridden during the month of August. This suggests that 4pm to 8pm are the hours where ride sharing is most frequently used, as well as 8 am, while 2 am to 5 am are hours where bike sharing use is at a minimum. 
3) A heat map to the stop time by day of week: showing what time during each weekday the bike sharing program is most often used. In this case, weekdays show increased usage during early morning or evening hours, suggest use by commuters on their way to work. On the weekend, the usage is more widespread, suggesting its used more often for tourism/ personal activities.
4) A second heat map to breakdown the results of 3) by gender. The patterns are similar across genders in terms of usage, but males use the program more frequently than any other gender.
5) A third heat map is used to break down usage by gender, day of the week, and customer type. Usage is similar across the days of the week relative to our analysis in 3. In addition, this heat map also reconfirms that males use the program more often. Finally, it shows that subscribers, rather than casual customers, more frequently use the bike sharing program.
6) A line graph that breaks down the trip duration in minutes and hours. This shows that most rides last 5-10 minutes and the frequency of rides decreases the longer the ride is. Around an hour mark, we can see that rides are not frequently longer than one hour.
7) A second line graph similar to 6) but broken down by gender. This graph reconfirms the insights in 4) and 6), where most rides last between 5-10 minutes and males more frequently use the bike sharing program.

## Summary

From the analysis, there are a few main insights we can gather from the New York City data: 
1) Bike sharing is most often used during the weekdays in the mornings or evenings. This suggests that during the week, commuters are the most prevalent users of the program. On weekends, the program is used on a more widespread basis throughout the day, suggesting tourists or people engaging in personal activities are using the bike sharing program more often.
2) Bike rides last 5-10 mins most frequently. After 5-10 mins, the frequency of rides gradually get smaller, and very few rides last longer than an hour. This suggests that most riders use the bike sharing program over shorter distances, a key insight for marketing purposes. 
3) The user base is mostly male subscribers. While female users and casual customers do use the program, the most usage is coming from males and from subscribers, another key marketing insight. 

With respect to Des Moines, Iowa, its important to understand the main differences between New York and a smaller city like Des Moines. New York is more densely populated and key places are closer to each other than they would be in Des Moines. This suggests that usage may be high as a result of number of people and ride length is short as a result of the shorter distance between two places. One future analysis would be to analyze the distance between two stations and how frequently rides occur on a per distance basis. For example, are users willing to ride longer distances? Des Moines will require users to ride longer distances. In addition, this visualization will help determine where stations should be placed. If users only ride for 5-10 minutes at max, its likely Des Moines will require stations that are within a 5-10 min distance of each other. 

A second analysis would be to collect and analyze more user data. Understanding that male subscribers is the largest user base is great. However, more demographic data would be nice in order to understand whether Des Moines has the appropriate user base. For example, with this dataset, we can also deetermine whether age (birth year) affects the usage and determine whether Des Moines has a similar population that would be interested in the bike sharing program. In addition, more data can be collected and analyzed on the demographics of users in New York in order to determine whether Des Moines is a place of significant interest to the investors.
